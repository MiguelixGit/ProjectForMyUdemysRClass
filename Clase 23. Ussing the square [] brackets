#Class 23. Using the [] brackets.

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
x[1] #With the square brackts you can access to the vector elements. Particullary this code gave you access to letter "a".
x[2] #This code gave you access to letter "b".
x[-1] #This this code you can access to all letters except "a".
z <- x[-2] #Whis this code you can access to all letters except "b", and also put the new vector into a new varibale.
x[1:3] #This code gave you letters "a", "b" and "c".
x[c(1,2,4)] #This code gave you letters "a", "b" and "d".
x[c(-1, -3)] #This code gave you letters "b", "d" and "e"
x[-3:-5] #This code gave you all letters of the vector x, except the "c", "d" and "e".
x[1:2] #This code gave you letters "a" and "b".
