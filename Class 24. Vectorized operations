#Class 24. Vectorized operations.

#To do an operation between vectors it is only needed to put the operator (+, -, *, /, >, <, etc.), because R is a vectorized languaje.

x<-c(1, 5, 10, 20, 100)
y<-c(3, 15, 50, 370, 765)
x+y #The console add 1 to 3, 5 to 15, 10 to 50, 20 to 370 and 100 to 765.

x2<-c(1, 3, 5)
y2<-c(2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12)
x2*y2 #To operate vectors with differents lengths the shorter vector will be recycle. In this case (x2+y2), x2 will duplicate to get the same lenght of y2. If the greater is not a multiple of the smaller vector it will also be recycled, but R give you a warning, though it will run anyway. 

#Practice
x3<-c(12, 23)
y3<-c(1, 34, 25)

x3>y3 #R give a warning message, but it run anyway.
x3+y3 #R give a warning message, but it run anyway.
