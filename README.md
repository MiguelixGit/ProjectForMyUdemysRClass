# ProjectForMyUdemysRClass
This is my first project on R.
I am Miguel, a university student of Law and Economics. I'm doing this project to get familiar with Rstudio and Github, as well as putting my English into practice. The R scripts are based on the classes (videos) in the course "R A-Z â„¢ Programming: R for Data Science with Real Exercises!" from the Udemy platform.
Well, if you are coursing this course, maybe this repo may help you.
