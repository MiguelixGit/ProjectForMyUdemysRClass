#Class 19. HOMEWORK: Law of Large Numbers.

N<-10000000 #N is the number of tosses.
Counter<- 0 #"Counter" is the variable that counts how many times the condition is true: It starts from 0.
for(i in rnorm(N)){  
  if(i>-1 & i<1){
    Counter<- Counter+1}}
Counter/N

#Now, we must compare "Counter/N" with 0.682.

#For N<-10 the console gave: 0.8
#For N<-100 the console gave: 0.71
#For N<-1000 the console gave: 0.685
#For N<-10000 the console gave: 0.6783
#For N<-100000 the console gave: 0.68335 
#For N<-1000000 the console gave: 0.682375
