C <- A + B

#Variable 1
Var1 <- 2.5

#Variable 2
Var2 <- 4

Result <- Var1 / Var2
Answer <- sqrt(Var2)

Greeting <- "Hello"
Name <- "Bob"
Message <- paste(Greeting, Name)

#Other operations
paste(Message, Result)

Var2 * Var1 / A - C
X <- Var2 * Var1 
Y <- A - C
X / Y

#Well, really I got several doubts with the answer of line 25 (Answer gave me -2, but according to the console the correct answer is 14...)
#UPDATE to line 30: I had forgotten that multiplication and division work first and then addition and subtraction. Sorry for this big mistake. :)
