#Class 14. The "While" Loop.


while(FALSE){print("Hello")}
#Since ("FALSE") is always FALSE, the command {print("Hello")} is not executed.  

while(TRUE){print("Hello")}
#Since ("TRUE") is alwayes TRUE, the command {print("Hello")} is executed infinitely.
#To stop this infinite execution of "Hello" in the console, you can press "Esc" key.

#Example
C <- 1
while(C < 12){print(C) 
  C <- C + 1}

#NOTE: I tried to execute the command "while(C < 12){print(C)C <- C + 1}" all in just one line and the console gave me "Error: unexpected symbol in "while(C < 12){print(C) C", so, I separated it in two lines. According to Casta, executed the command in just one line is impossible because R do not recognize the command "print + assing" as just one command, so you have to separate it in two: first, the command "print", and then, the command "assing".
